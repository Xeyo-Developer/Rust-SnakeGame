```bash
cargo run
```

## 🎯 Game Rules

1. **Goal**: Collect food (golden squares) to grow the snake
2. **Game Over**: Hit the wall or your own tail
3. **Restart**: Game automatically restarts after 1 second from game over
4. **Movement**: Snake moves automatically, you only control the direction

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project consists of five main modules:

### `main.rs`
- Application entry point
- Game window configuration (27x22 blocks)
- Main game loop handling events and rendering

### `game.rs`
- Game logic and state management
- Collision handling and win/lose condition checking
- Food generation in random positions
- Snake movement timer (200ms per move)

### `snake.rs`
- Snake implementation as a linked list of blocks
- Movement and direction handling
- Tongue animation with random timing
- Self-collision detection

### `drawing.rs`
- All graphics rendering functions
- Game coordinates to pixel conversion
- Drawing blocks, eyes, tongue, and borders
- Visual effects (gradients, shadows)
